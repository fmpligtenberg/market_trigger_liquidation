    "one way to measure the sensitivity to liquidation for a loan backed by a cryptocurrency is to calculate the \"crypto-liquidation value\" (CLV). The CLV is the percentage decrease in the price of the cryptocurrency that would result in the loan being fully liquidated (i.e., the value of the collateral is equal to or less than the outstanding loan balance).\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for CLV is:\n",
    "\n",
    "CLV = (LTV - 1) / (1 - MC)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LTV is the loan-to-value ratio, expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.5 for a 50% LTV. The loan-to-value ratio is the ratio of the loan amount to the value of the collateral.\n",
    "- MC is the maintenance collateral, expressed as a decimal (e.g., 0.15 for a 15% maintenance collateral). The maintenance collateral is the minimum collateral value required to maintain the loan. If the value of the collateral falls below the maintenance collateral, the lender may initiate a liquidation of the collateral to recover the loan amount. For example, if the maintenance collateral is set at 15%, the value of the collateral must be at least 15% higher than the outstanding loan balance to avoid liquidation.\n",
    " \n",
    "The CLV formula calculates the percentage decrease in the price of the cryptocurrency that would result in the loan being fully liquidated. For example, if the CLV is 30%, a 30% decrease in the price of the cryptocurrency would result in the value of the collateral being equal to or less than the outstanding loan balance, triggering liquidation.\n",

    "It is my understanding that LTV must be =< 0.67 (150% colateral)\n",
